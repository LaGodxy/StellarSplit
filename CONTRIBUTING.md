## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/OlufunbiIK/stellarsplit
cd stellarsplit

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/OlufunbiIK/stellarsplit
```

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Configure your .env with:
# - STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet (use testnet for development)
# - DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection
# - OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key (optional, for better OCR)
# - EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY=your_key (for currency conversion)

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate

# Start development servers (runs both frontend and backend)
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:4000`

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks
- `ui/` - UI/UX improvements

---

## Before You Start Coding

### Find or Create an Issue

- Check [existing issues](https://github.com/OlufunbiIK/stellarsplit/issues) to avoid duplication
- For bugs, search closed issues - it might already be fixed
- For new features, open an issue to discuss before implementing
- Comment on an issue to express interest or ask questions

### Good First Issues

Look for issues tagged with:
- `good-first-issue` - Great for newcomers
- `help-wanted` - We need community help
- `documentation` - Improve docs
- `ui-enhancement` - Visual improvements
- `drips-wave` - Eligible for Wave rewards

### Issue Application (for Drips Wave)

If you're applying through Drips Wave:
1. Apply via the Drips Wave platform (not just GitHub comments)
2. Wait for maintainer approval before starting work
3. Only one contributor per issue
4. Respect the assignment - don't work on issues assigned to others
5. Communicate if you need more time or encounter blockers

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use automated tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Type check
npm run type-check
```

**Standards:**
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing code patterns
- Write meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use functional components in React
- Prefer hooks over class components

### Mobile-First Development

Since StellarSplit is mobile-first:
- Test on actual mobile devices when possible
- Use Chrome DevTools mobile emulation
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px
- Test on slow network connections
- Optimize images and assets for mobile
- Use responsive design patterns

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): subject

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `perf:` - Performance improvements

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(ocr): add OpenAI Vision API integration for better receipt scanning

fix(split): resolve incorrect tax distribution in itemized splits

docs(readme): add mobile testing instructions

test(payment): add integration tests for Stellar transactions

perf(camera): optimize image compression before upload
```

### Testing

All code contributions should include tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e
```

**Test Guidelines:**
- Write unit tests for new functions and components
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Aim for >80% code coverage on new code
- Test mobile-specific functionality
- Test with different screen sizes

### Stellar Integration

When working with Stellar:

- **Use Testnet** for development (never use mainnet keys in code)
- **Test thoroughly** - blockchain transactions are irreversible
- **Handle errors** - Network issues, insufficient balance, etc.
- **Document** - Explain Stellar-specific logic clearly
- **Test edge cases** - Invalid addresses, failed transactions, etc.

```typescript
// Good: Proper error handling
try {
  const transaction = await sendPayment(recipient, amount);
  return { success: true, txHash: transaction.hash };
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE') {
    return { success: false, error: 'Not enough XLM' };
  }
  if (error.code === 'INVALID_ADDRESS') {
    return { success: false, error: 'Invalid Stellar address' };
  }
  throw error;
}
```

### OCR Development

When working with receipt scanning:

- **Test with real receipts** - Different formats, lighting conditions
- **Handle failures gracefully** - Allow manual entry as fallback
- **Provide feedback** - Show confidence scores, allow editing
- **Privacy-first** - Process locally when possible
- **Optimize images** - Compress before sending to API
